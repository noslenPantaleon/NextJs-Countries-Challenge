- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page

## My process

1- create a prototype object from the api response to learn more about the data.
2- create main components and html and css structure
3- fecht api data
4- fix scss and components
5- add theme switcher
6- add responsive design scss
6- add animations
7- Fix all details and error messages
8- Prepare for production and deployment

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Web-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- Framer Motion

### What I learned

This project helps me to practice and build a responsive site using typescript and NextJS, and I experimented with simple animations, which was great!, and I also learned how to use the theme color scheme and more about pagination.

### Continued development

Continue fixing details, and I would like to add a dashboard with the data available.
